# üö´ Removed "Approval Status" from Edit Event - Summary

## Issue Fixed ‚úÖ

**Problem**: When organizers clicked "Edit" on their events, they could see and modify the "Approval Status" dropdown, which allowed them to change event approval status from "Pending" to "Approved" or "Denied".

**Solution**: Completely removed the approval status control from the edit event form and ensured the backend preserves the existing status without allowing organizers to modify it.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Frontend - Edit Event Template**
**File**: `templates/edit-event.html`

**Removed**: Entire "Approval Status" form group (lines 123-129)
```html
<!-- REMOVED THIS SECTION -->
<!--
<div class="form-group">
   <label for="event-status">Approval Status</label>
   <select id="event-status" name="status">
       <option value="pending" {% if event.status == 'pending' %}selected{% endif %}>Pending</option>
       <option value="approved" {% if event.status == 'approved' %}selected{% endif %}>Approved</option>
       <option value="denied" {% if event.status == 'denied' %}selected{% endif %}>Denied</option>
   </select>
</div>
-->
```

### 2. **Backend - Edit Event Logic**
**File**: `accounts/views.py` - `edit_event()` function

**Before**:
```python
# Save status from form cleaned data
event.status = form.cleaned_data.get('status', event.status)
```

**After**:
```python
# Preserve existing status - organizers cannot change approval status
# Status can only be changed by admins through the admin panel
```

**Impact**: The event status is now preserved during edits and cannot be modified by organizers.

1. **Clean Edit Form**: No "Approval Status" dropdown visible
2. **Status Preservation**: Event approval status remains unchanged during edits
3. **Admin Control**: Only administrators can change approval status through admin panel
4. **Professional Workflow**: Organizers focus on event content, admins handle approval

### ‚úÖ **Edit Event Workflow:**

1. **Organizer Edits Event** ‚Üí Can modify: title, description, date, time, location, flyer, registration link
2. **Status Unchanged** ‚Üí Approval status remains as set by admin (pending/approved/denied)
3. **Form Submission** ‚Üí Only allowed fields are updated
4. **Admin Approval** ‚Üí Separate process through admin panel for status changes

## Admin Control Preserved

3. **Approval Reasons**: Add denial reasons for feedback
4. **Status Tracking**: Full visibility of approval lifecycle
5. **Quality Control**: Review event content before approval

---

## Files Modified

1. **`templates/edit-event.html`**: Removed approval status dropdown
2. **`accounts/views.py`**: Updated edit_event function to preserve status

---

## Testing Verification

To verify the fix:

1. **Login as Organizer**
2. **Go to Dashboard** ‚Üí View your events
3. **Click "Edit"** on any event
4. **Verify**: No "Approval Status" dropdown visible
5. **Edit Event Details** ‚Üí Save changes
6. **Check**: Event status remains unchanged
7. **Admin Panel**: Admins can still change status

## Summary

The "Approval Status" dropdown has been completely removed from the edit event interface. Organizers can now only edit event content while the approval status remains under administrative control. This creates a proper separation of responsibilities where organizers manage event details and administrators control the approval workflow.
