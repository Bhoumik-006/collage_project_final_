# Organizer Account Creation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Redirect After Account Creation**
**Problem**: After creating an organizer account, the system was redirecting to a generic login page instead of the organizer login.

**Solution**: Modified the `organizer_signup` view in `accounts/views.py`:
- Instead of using `redirect('login')`, now renders the login template directly
- Passes context variables to pre-select organizer tab and populate email field
- Sets `auto_select_organizer=True` and `account_created=True` flags

### 2. **Remove "Create Organizer Account" Button**
**Problem**: After successful account creation, the blue "Create Organizer Account" button was still showing at the bottom.

**Solution**: Updated the login template (`templates/login.html`):
- Added conditional check `{% if not account_created %}`
- Only shows the "Create Organizer Account" button when not coming from successful registration
- Button is hidden when `account_created=True` is passed from the view

### 3. **Auto-Select Organizer Tab**
**Problem**: After account creation, the student tab was selected by default instead of organizer.

**Solution**: Enhanced JavaScript in login template:
- Added conditional initialization based on `auto_select_organizer` flag
- If coming from organizer registration, automatically shows organizer forms
- Pre-fills the email field with the registered email

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Updated `accounts/views.py` - organizer_signup function:
```python
# Before
messages.success(request, 'Account created successfully! You can now access both Student and Organizer features. Please log in.')
return redirect('login')

# After  
messages.success(request, 'Account created successfully! You can now access both Student and Organizer features. Please log in.')
return render(request, 'login.html', {
    'email': email,
    'user_type': 'organizer',
    'auto_select_organizer': True,
    'account_created': True
})
```

### 2. Updated `templates/login.html` - Organizer form section:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background: #f0f9ff; border: 2px solid #0ea5e9; border-radius: 8px;">
  <h4 style="margin: 0 0 10px 0; color: #0369a1;">New Organizer?</h4>
  <button type="button" onclick="window.location.href='{% url 'organizer_signup' %}'" style="...">
    Create Organizer Account →
  </button>
</div>

<!-- After -->
{% if not account_created %}
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background: #f0f9ff; border: 2px solid #0ea5e9; border-radius: 8px;">
  <h4 style="margin: 0 0 10px 0; color: #0369a1;">New Organizer?</h4>
  <button type="button" onclick="window.location.href='{% url 'organizer_signup' %}'" style="...">
    Create Organizer Account →
  </button>
</div>
{% endif %}
```

### 3. Updated JavaScript initialization:
```javascript
// Before
// Initialize - show student forms by default
showStudent();

// After
// Initialize - show appropriate forms based on context
{% if auto_select_organizer %}
    showOrganizer();
{% else %}
    showStudent();
{% endif %}
```

### 4. Added email pre-filling:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Organizer Email Address" required>

<!-- After -->
<input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Organizer Email Address" value="{{ email|default:'' }}" required>
```
